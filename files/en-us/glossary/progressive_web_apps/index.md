Progressive web apps is a term used to describe the modern state of web app development. This involves taking standard websites/apps that enjoy all the best parts of the Web — such as discoverability via search engines, being linkable via {{Glossary("URL")}}s, and working across multiple form factors — and progressively enhancing them with modern APIs (such as [Service Workers](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API) and [Push](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Push_API)), enabling features that confer benefits more commonly attributed to native apps.

These features include being installable, working offline, and being easy to sync with and re-engaging the user from the server.
